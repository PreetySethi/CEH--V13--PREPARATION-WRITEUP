# Module 03 — Scanning Networks

## Objective

Understand how network scanning is used to discover systems, open ports, running services, and possible weaknesses in a target environment.
Scanning transforms reconnaissance information into technical details that help build an attack surface map.

---

## Network Scanning Overview

Network scanning is performed to:

* Identify live hosts in a network
* Discover open ports
* Detect running services and versions
* Identify operating systems
* Understand network structure
* Locate possible entry points

Scanning is an active phase and may generate logs or alerts on the target network.

---

## Types of Scanning

### Host Discovery

Used to find active systems before deeper scanning.

Methods:

* ICMP echo requests (ping)
* ARP scanning (local network)
* TCP ping

Examples:

```
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
nmap -PE <target>
```

---

### Port Scanning

Used to determine which ports are open and listening.

Common scan types:

* TCP Connect Scan

  * Completes full TCP handshake
  * Reliable but easier to detect

```
nmap -sT <target>
```

* SYN Scan (Half-open scan)

  * Does not complete handshake
  * Faster and stealthier

```
nmap -sS <target>
```

* UDP Scan

  * Checks UDP services
  * Slower and sometimes unreliable

```
nmap -sU <target>
```

---

### Service and Version Detection

Used to identify applications running on open ports.

```
nmap -sV <target>
```

Information gathered:

* Service name
* Application version
* Possible outdated software

---

### OS Detection

Attempts to identify the operating system based on network responses.

```
nmap -O <target>
```

---

### Aggressive Scan

Combines multiple techniques (OS detection, version detection, scripts, traceroute).

```
nmap -A <target>
```

---

## Port States

* Open
  Port accepts connections and a service is running.

* Closed
  Port is reachable but no service is listening.

* Filtered
  Traffic is blocked by a firewall or filtering device.

* Unfiltered
  Port is accessible but state cannot be determined.

---

## Important Nmap Options

Scan specific ports:

```
nmap -p 80,443 <target>
```

Scan port range:

```
nmap -p 1-1000 <target>
```

Scan all ports:

```
nmap -p- <target>
```

Save output:

```
nmap -oN scan.txt <target>
nmap -oX scan.xml <target>
```

Increase speed:

```
nmap -T4 <target>
```

---

## Key Concepts Learned

* Open ports expose services that may be exploitable.
* Service version detection is critical for vulnerability research.
* Scanning speed affects accuracy and detectability.
* Different scan types provide different levels of stealth.

---

## Common Services Seen During Scans

* Port 21 — FTP
* Port 22 — SSH
* Port 23 — Telnet
* Port 53 — DNS
* Port 80 — HTTP
* Port 443 — HTTPS
* Port 3389 — RDP

---

## Practical Observations

* Initial host discovery reduces scanning time.
* Scanning all ports sometimes reveals unexpected services.
* Reading Nmap output carefully is more important than running many commands.
* Firewalls can hide real network information.

---

## Legal and Ethical Notes

* Network scanning must only be done in authorized environments.
* Unauthorized scanning can be considered illegal.
* Always follow rules of engagement during testing.

---

## Summary

Scanning networks provides technical visibility into targets by identifying hosts, ports, services, and operating systems.
This phase is essential for planning further security testing and identifying potential attack paths.
