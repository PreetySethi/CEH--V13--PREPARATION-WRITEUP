# Module 02 — Footprinting & Reconnaissance

## Objective

Understand how information gathering works before active testing.
The goal is to collect useful data about a target using passive and legal techniques.

---

## Key Concepts

### Footprinting

Footprinting is the process of gathering information about a target system, organization, or network before attempting any form of scanning or exploitation.

**Main goals:**

* Identify target infrastructure
* Find public information
* Understand attack surface

---

### Passive vs Active Reconnaissance

**Passive Recon**

* No direct interaction with target
* Hard to detect
* Uses public information

Examples:

* Search engines
* Social media
* Public records

**Active Recon**

* Direct interaction with target systems
* Easier to detect
* Usually done later during scanning

Examples:

* DNS queries
* Network probing

---

## OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

Information collected from publicly available sources.

Common sources:

* Search engines
* Company websites
* Job postings
* Social media profiles
* Public documents

---

## DNS & Domain Footprinting

Useful information:

* Domain owner details (Whois)
* Nameservers
* IP addresses
* Subdomains

Basic commands/tools mentioned:

* whois
* nslookup
* dig (concept)

---

## Tools / Techniques Introduced

* Google search operators (basic dorking)
* Whois lookup
* DNS enumeration concepts
* Website information gathering

---

## Important Notes

* Reconnaissance is usually the longest phase of an assessment.
* Small public details can reveal major security risks.
* Always stay within legal and authorized boundaries.

---

## Personal Notes

* Passive recon feels like investigation rather than hacking.
* Organization of collected info is very important.
* Need more practice with DNS concepts.

---

## Summary

Footprinting helps understand a target before any technical attack begins.
Good reconnaissance makes later stages easier and more efficient.
